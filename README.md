# Traffic-Light-Optimization
Implementation of a genetic algorithm optimizer of traffic light timing for S&DS 431- Optimization and Computation final project.
- Optimization criterion: time loss (extra penalty for teleportation)
- Optimizes over cycle time, offset time, active time shares
- Integrates with SUMO for simulation
- Files in sumo/ correspond to map of Yale's campus + randomly generated routes within it
